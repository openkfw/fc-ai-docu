# Drafting Reporting from Structured Data

<Disclaimer />

## 1. Short Introduction & Background

Development organizations and humanitarian agencies require regular impact reports outlining the reach and effectiveness of their activities, specifically detailing the number of beneficiaries served and the types of assistance provided. Data is typically collected continuously within organizational systems and subsequently transformed into narrative reports based on quantitative data extracted from these systems.

## 2. Use Case Overview

### Problem Statement

The current process for generating impact reports for donors, which relies on extensive quantitative data from organizational systems managed through Excel spreadsheets, is a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive endeavor for humanitarian staff.

### Objective

This Proof of Concept (PoC) aims to develop and validate an AI-driven prototype capable of generating initial drafts of narrative impact reports. The primary goal is to significantly reduce the manual effort and time currently required for report creation.

## 3. Scope of the POC

### In-Scope

The POC will focus on demonstrating the AI's capability to generate report drafts based on provided data and guidelines. Key functionalities include:

- Ingestion of indicator data from Excel/CSV spreadsheets.
- Adherence of AI-generated text to specified guidelines:
  - Prioritization of reporting higher numbers of key indicators over lower numbers.
  - Ensuring all key indicators are reported.
  - Breakdown of reporting by gender, location, and thematic categories.
- Generation of report drafts according to the structure of the sample narrative report, specifically covering the ICLA (Information, Counselling, and Legal Assistance) section.
- Prioritization of the standard donor report type, among the three report types generated by the NGO's system.
- Utilization of Excel spreadsheets and narrative context information as inputs.
- Implementation of a multi-step process:
  1. Pre-processing of spreadsheets (e.g., Excel-to-JSON conversion) to consolidate data and optimize for AI processing, thereby reducing input context length.
  2. Generation of report sections detailing:
     - Number of individuals with specific traits (age group, disability, displacement status, sex, nationality).
     - Counseling services received (e.g., Legal Identity, Employment Law and Procedures).
     - Association with field office and area office.
  3. Integration of provided narrative context information to enrich the quantitative data.

### Out-of-Scope

- Full automation of the end-to-end report generation and submission process.
- Direct integration with the NGO's live system or other production environments.
- Generation of report types other than the prioritized standard donor report, unless explicitly agreed upon during development.

## 4. Approach & Methodology

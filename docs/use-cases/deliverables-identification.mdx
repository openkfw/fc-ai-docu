## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a proof-of-concept (PoC) for applying generative artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency of contractual analysis in international development cooperation. The primary challenge addressed is the substantial manual effort required by technical experts and project managers to identify and extract key deliverables from extensive contractual documents. This process is often complicated by document length and varying interpretations of deliverable definitions across different stakeholder roles.

## 2. Use Case Overview

### Problem Statement

The manual identification and extraction of deliverables from lengthy contractual agreements (frequently exceeding 500 pages) is a resource-intensive and time-consuming undertaking. This challenge is exacerbated by diverse definitions of "deliverables" employed by various stakeholders, including technical experts, project managers, and external partners, leading to inconsistencies and potential oversights in project planning and execution.

### Objective

This PoC aims to develop and validate an AI-powered prototype capable of automatically identifying and extracting deliverables from complex contract documents, specifically focusing on technical requirements and standardized definitions. The solution intends to significantly reduce the time and effort associated with manual contract review processes while improving consistency and completeness of deliverable identification.

## 3. Scope of the PoC

### In-Scope

* Automated extraction of deliverables from contractual documents with typical lengths of 200 pages or more.
* Presentation of extracted deliverables in a structured tabular format, including precise references to corresponding page numbers or chapter/section identifiers within the source contract.
* Focused extraction of deliverables aligned with standardized technical definitions and international best practices.
* Hierarchical prioritization of deliverables based on established engineering and project management frameworks.

### Out-of-Scope

* Extraction of deliverables for specialized stakeholder perspectives beyond standard technical requirements.
* Integration with live contract management systems or production environments.
* Legal interpretation or compliance assessment of contractual obligations.

## 4. Approach & Methodology

The PoC employs a rapid prototyping methodology, leveraging AI development platforms for agile development and iterative testing of extraction models.

### Success Metrics

* **Extraction Accuracy:** Qualitative assessment by domain experts on the accuracy and relevance of deliverables extracted from contracts.
* **Completeness of Reference:** Percentage of extracted deliverables correctly linked to their source location (page/chapter) in the contract.
* **Efficiency Gains:** Reduction in time required for manual contract analysis and deliverable identification.

### Deliverables

* A functional prototype capable of ingesting contract documents and outputting a structured list of identified deliverables.
* A final evaluation report detailing PoC results, limitations, and recommendations for future development.

## 5. Success Criteria & Expected Outcomes

The success of this PoC will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

### Success Criteria

* Demonstration of the prototype's capability to identify and extract a significant majority of relevant deliverables from sample contracts with acceptable precision.
* Substantial reduction in the average time required for technical experts to identify deliverables compared to manual processes.
* Positive qualitative feedback from evaluating domain experts regarding the utility and usability of the prototype.

### Expected Outcomes

* Validation of AI's applicability for automating deliverable identification in complex contracts.
* Quantifiable insights into potential time savings and efficiency gains in contract analysis workflows.
* Identification of current limitations and areas for future development to enhance solution robustness and accuracy.

## 6. Requirements & Dependencies

### Resources

* A representative set of contract documents with varying lengths and complexity levels.
* Clearly articulated and documented definitions of "deliverables" from technical and project management perspectives, including examples and categorizations.
* Access to domain experts for iterative feedback, requirement clarification, and validation of extracted deliverables.

### Dependencies

* Availability and quality of contract documents in machine-readable formats with clear language structure.
* Timely availability of domain experts for consultation and feedback sessions.
* Clarity and consistency of deliverable definitions and categorization frameworks.

## 7. Implementation Approach

The PoC implementation follows a systematic approach utilizing AI-powered document analysis to automate the identification and extraction of deliverables from contractual documents. The implementation consists of two main processing stages that work together to analyze contracts and present findings in a structured format.

### 7.1 Document Analysis and Deliverable Identification

**Overview:** This functionality provides automated analysis of contractual documents to identify deliverables based on standardized technical definitions and categorization frameworks.

**Process Description:**

The document analysis process operates through systematic review of contractual content:

**Contract Document Processing:**

* Comprehensive review of contract documents to locate mentions of deliverables
* Application of standardized deliverable definitions and categorization criteria
* Identification of technical documents related to system components and subsystems

**Deliverable Categorization:**

The system identifies deliverables across four main categories:

* **Certification Documents:** Third-party verification documents showing compliance with technical standards (referencing standards such as IEC, ISO, EN, IS)
* **Technical Documentation:** Documents providing technical details, operational instructions, and maintenance guidance (handbooks, instruction manuals, technical specifications)
* **Test and Analysis Reports:** Documents presenting results from testing and analysis of technical systems, including measured values and performance data
* **Supplier Credentials:** Documentation demonstrating company experience and qualifications in providing technical products and services

**Key Features:**

* Automated recognition of deliverable terminology and technical language
* Systematic application of categorization frameworks
* Extraction of precise document references and location information
* Comprehensive coverage of contract content regardless of document length

### 7.2 Structured Output Generation

**Overview:** This functionality organizes identified deliverables into structured, accessible formats for review and project planning purposes.

**Process Description:**

The output generation process creates comprehensive deliverable summaries:

**Information Compilation:**

* Extraction of deliverable names and concise titles
* Generation of descriptive summaries for each identified deliverable
* Accurate attribution to specific contract sections, chapters, or page references

**Structured Presentation:**

* Organization of deliverables in tabular format for easy review
* Clear categorization and hierarchical organization when applicable
* Comprehensive referencing to source document locations

**Key Features:**

* Standardized output format ensuring consistency across different contracts
* Clear and accessible presentation suitable for technical and management review
* Comprehensive documentation supporting project planning and compliance activities

### 7.3 Workflow Implementation

The automated deliverable identification process follows these conceptual steps:

1. **Document Ingestion:** Contract documents are processed through AI-powered document analysis systems
2. **Content Analysis:** Systematic review of contract content to identify potential deliverables based on standardized definitions
3. **Categorization and Validation:** Application of deliverable categorization frameworks to ensure accurate identification
4. **Reference Extraction:** Precise attribution of deliverables to specific document sections and locations
5. **Structured Output Generation:** Compilation of findings into accessible tabular formats for stakeholder review

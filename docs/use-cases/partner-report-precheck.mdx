**SDG Impact:** Strengthens accountability and trust in development partnerships through enhanced report validation and quality assurance

<Disclaimer />

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a proof-of-concept (PoC) that leverages generative artificial intelligence to enhance partner reporting validation processes in international development cooperation. Manual review of partner reports is often resource-intensive, resulting in incomplete submissions, extended review cycles, and multiple revision rounds. This PoC explores AI's potential to streamline validation workflows, improving efficiency and report quality while maintaining the rigor required for development project monitoring.

## 2. Use Case Overview

### Problem Statement

The manual validation of partner reports, critical for monitoring active development projects, is a resource-intensive process. It is frequently hampered by inconsistencies and incompleteness in the submitted documents, leading to significant administrative overhead, prolonged review cycles, and delays in reporting for both implementing partners and project managers.

### Objective

The primary objective of this PoC is to develop and evaluate an AI-driven prototype capable of automating key aspects of the partner report validation process. Specifically, the PoC will focus on assessing the consistency of performance indicators between partner reports and their corresponding project agreements, thereby aiming to reduce manual verification effort and improve the accuracy of initial submissions.

## 3. Scope of the PoC

### In-Scope

The PoC will demonstrate the following core functionalities:

- Automated extraction of performance indicators (including baseline, target, and actual values) from two distinct source documents: the implementation report and the project agreement.
- Compilation of extracted indicators from both documents into a structured format, such as a comparative table.
- Automated assessment of consistency between the indicator values presented in the implementation report and the project agreement, utilizing a predefined multi-level review scale (e.g., a 3-step system indicating match, mismatch, or partial match).

### Out-of-Scope

This PoC will not include:

- Development of a production-ready, fully integrated system.
- Comprehensive validation of all content within the partner reports beyond the specified indicators.
- Direct integration with existing backend systems for automated data ingestion or report submission, beyond the prototype environment.

## 4. Approach & Methodology

The PoC will be developed using a rapid prototyping methodology, leveraging AI development platforms to accelerate development and iteration. This approach allows for flexible adjustments based on interim findings and feedback from domain experts.

## 5. Success Criteria & Expected Outcomes

### Metrics

The success of the PoC will be evaluated based on the following key metrics:

- **Indicator Extraction Accuracy:** Percentage of indicators correctly extracted from implementation reports and project agreements.
- **Indicator Mapping Accuracy:** Percentage of extracted indicators correctly mapped between the two source documents.
- **Consistency Assessment Effectiveness:** Qualitative assessment by domain experts on the plausibility and usefulness of the AI's consistency evaluation using multi-level review scales.
- **User Feedback:** Qualitative feedback from project managers and other stakeholders on the prototype's usability, clarity of output, and perceived value.
- **Efficiency Gains:** Estimated reduction in time required for validating indicator consistency and overall reporting quality assurance processes.

### Deliverables

- A functional AI prototype demonstrating the in-scope capabilities for automated indicator extraction and consistency assessment.
- A final report summarizing the PoC development process, evaluation results, and recommendations for future development.

## 6. Requirements & Dependencies

### Resources

- **Input Documents:** Access to representative implementation reports and their corresponding project agreements is required.
- **Domain Expertise:** Regular availability of domain experts is crucial for providing domain-specific insights, clarifying requirements, validating interim results, and offering feedback on the prototype.

### Dependencies

- **Document Quality and Consistency:** The performance of the AI model will depend on the quality, formatting consistency, and structural predictability of the input documents. Significant variations may impact extraction accuracy.
- **Timely Feedback:** Iterative development relies on prompt and constructive feedback from domain experts and stakeholders.

## 7. Implementation Approach

The PoC implementation follows a structured approach utilizing AI-powered processes to address automated validation of partner reports. The implementation consists of three main components that work together to extract, compare, and assess performance indicators across project documentation.

### 7.1 Automated Data Extraction

**Overview:** This functionality provides automated extraction of performance indicators from project documentation using AI-powered text analysis and natural language processing.

**Process Description:**

The data extraction process operates through parallel analysis of two key document types:

**Project Agreement Analysis:**

- Identification and extraction of defined performance indicators
- Capture of baseline values, target values, and measurement criteria
- Structured organization of indicator definitions and requirements

**Implementation Report Analysis:**

- Extraction of reported performance data and actual values
- Identification of indicator progress and achievements
- Capture of explanatory comments and contextual information

**Key Features:**

- Automated recognition of indicator terminology and structures
- Flexible extraction adapting to various document formats
- Preservation of source references for verification
- Standardized data formatting for comparison processes

### 7.2 Consistency Assessment and Validation

**Overview:** This functionality performs systematic comparison of extracted indicators to identify discrepancies, assess report completeness, and provide structured feedback on consistency.

**Process Description:**

The validation process operates through multi-dimensional analysis:

**Indicator Matching:**

- Cross-referencing indicators between project agreements and implementation reports
- Semantic analysis to identify equivalent indicators with varying terminology
- Mapping of related performance measures and metrics

**Consistency Evaluation:**

- Comparison of baseline, target, and actual values across documents
- Assessment of data completeness and quality
- Identification of missing or inconsistent information

**Quality Scoring:**

- Multi-level assessment system providing clear consistency ratings
- Systematic evaluation based on predefined criteria
- Generation of actionable feedback and recommendations

**Key Features:**

- Intelligent indicator matching across document variations

### 7.3 Workflow Implementation

The automated validation process follows these conceptual steps:

1. **Document Ingestion:** Both project agreements and implementation reports are processed through document analysis systems
2. **Parallel Extraction:** Performance indicators are simultaneously extracted from both document types
3. **Semantic Matching:** AI systems identify corresponding indicators across documents, accounting for terminology variations
4. **Consistency Analysis:** Extracted data is systematically compared across multiple dimensions
5. **Assessment Generation:** Comprehensive validation reports are produced with actionable feedback

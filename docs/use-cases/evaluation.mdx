# Drafting Evaluation Report 

<Disclaimer />

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a proof-of-concept for applying artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency of ex-post evaluation reporting in international development cooperation. The primary challenge addressed is the significant manual effort and time dedicated to drafting specific sections of evaluation reports, particularly those requiring synthesis of information from multiple source documents. This initiative explores the potential of AI to streamline the creation of evaluation report components, enabling evaluators to focus more on high-value analytical tasks.

## 2. Use Case Overview

### Problem Statement

Development organizations conduct numerous ex-post evaluations annually, with evaluators responsible for producing comprehensive assessment reports. A substantial portion of this workload involves the manual compilation and synthesis of information for specific report chapters. Many evaluations encompass multiple project phases or related initiatives, frequently necessitating the consolidation of information from several documents of the same type (e.g., multiple preliminary findings documents for different project components) into a single report. This requirement further compounds the drafting effort and time commitment.

### Objective

The proof-of-concept aims to develop and validate a prototype capable of automatically generating drafts for goal achievement sections of evaluation reports. This objective will be realized by leveraging AI to accurately extract, effectively synthesize, and logically structure relevant information from predefined source documents, particularly focusing on the assessment of intended project outcomes.

## 3. Scope of the PoC

### In-Scope

The PoC will demonstrate the following key features and functionalities:

* Automated generation of drafts for goal achievement sections of ex-post evaluation reports.
* This automated process encompasses:
  1. Extraction of the project's outcome-level goals from designated evaluation concept documents.
  2. Extraction of evaluated indicators from both evaluation concept and preliminary findings documents.
  3. Generation of goal achievement drafts, which will incorporate:
     * A concise summary of the project goal, including notation if and why the goal may have been revised during the project lifecycle.
     * A structured table of indicators, including mechanisms for excluding indicators deemed inappropriate based on predefined criteria.
     * A narrative summary derived from the synthesized information in the table of indicators.
     * An initial evaluation of goal achievement, which synthesizes quantitative data and qualitative evidence, weighted according to predefined logic to reflect their respective importance.

### Out-of-Scope

The following aspects are explicitly not addressed in this PoC phase:

* Automated generation of any other chapters or the entirety of the ex-post evaluation report.
* Direct integration with upstream or downstream reporting systems beyond the specified input documents and the output draft.
* The processing of document types other than evaluation concepts and preliminary findings for the purpose of generating goal achievement content.
* Final validation, editing, and ultimate approval of the AI-generated draft; these responsibilities remain with the evaluators.
* Development of a production-ready, fully integrated, and scalable system. This PoC is focused on demonstrating core generative capabilities and feasibility.

## 4. Approach & Methodology

The PoC will be executed employing a rapid prototyping methodology facilitated within AI development platforms. This agile approach is designed to support iterative development cycles and enable the swift incorporation of feedback from domain experts.

## 5. Success Criteria & Expected Outcomes

### Success Metrics

The success of the PoC will be evaluated based on the following measurable criteria:

* **Time Savings:** A quantifiable reduction in the time required for evaluators to draft goal achievement sections of evaluation reports. The target is an estimated 20-30% reduction in effort for this specific task, post-prototype adoption.
* **Quality of Generated Draft:** Assessed through:
  * *Accuracy:* The correctness of extracted information, including project goals, indicators, and reported results, when compared against source documents.
  * *Coherence:* The logical flow, clarity, and readability of the AI-generated text.
  * *Completeness:* The inclusion of all pertinent information from the specified sections of the source documents relevant to goal achievement assessment.
* **User Satisfaction:** Qualitative feedback solicited from evaluators regarding the usability, reliability, and overall utility of the prototype in their reporting workflow.

### Deliverables

* A functional AI prototype capable of generating drafts for goal achievement sections of ex-post evaluation reports, based on the processing of evaluation concept and preliminary findings documents.
* A comprehensive evaluation report detailing PoC results, limitations, and recommendations for future development.

## 6. Requirements & Dependencies

### Resources

The following resources are essential for the successful execution of the PoC:

* **Input Documents:** Access to a representative corpus of evaluation concept and preliminary findings documents. The structural integrity, clarity, and consistency of these documents are paramount, as they constitute the primary knowledge base for the AI information flow. This includes:
  * Clearly articulated project goals and indicators within the evaluation concept documents.
  * Detailed actual achievements, encompassing quantitative results (e.g., tables of indicators with statuses such as "fulfilled" or "not fulfilled") and relevant qualitative or anecdotal evidence documented within the preliminary findings.
* **Domain Expertise:** Consistent availability of domain experts (evaluators) is required for:
  * Clarification of content, context, and nuances within the source documents.
  * Validation of AI-generated outputs against source materials and expert knowledge.
  * Provision of iterative feedback on prototype usability, performance, and alignment with reporting standards.
  * Guidance on establishing the relative weighting and interpretation of quantitative versus anecdotal evidence in the context of goal achievement.

### Dependencies

The successful completion and outcomes of the PoC are contingent upon the following factors:

* **Quality of Source Data:** The performance and accuracy of the prototype are highly dependent on the clarity, consistency, and structured nature of the input documents. Ambiguities, inconsistencies, or poorly structured information within source materials may adversely affect the quality of the generated output.
* **Iterative Feedback Loop:** The commitment to a timely and constructive feedback loop involving domain experts is crucial for the agile refinement of the prototype.

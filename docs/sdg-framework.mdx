# AI for SDGs

## Overview

The [Hamburg Declaration on Responsible Artificial Intelligence for the Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.bmz-digital.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250603_Hamburg_Declaration-1.pdf) provides a framework for responsible AI development aligned with the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Our AI use cases in financial cooperation are designed to investigate how this framework might be operationalized within in financial cooperation. This way we attempt to ensure that technological innovation serves the broader goals of sustainable development through the **five key pillars**.

## The Five Pillars

### <SDGBadge pillar="People" compact={true} /> People - Advancing Human Rights, Gender Equality and Inclusivity

We prioritize human-centric AI that respects human rights, promotes inclusion, and ensures AI benefits are accessible to all, particularly vulnerable populations.

**Key Principles:**
- Human-rights-based approach throughout AI lifecycle
- Inclusive participation of marginalized groups
- Trust, safety, and protection from algorithmic bias
- Accessibility and digital equity

**Our Use Cases:**
- [Birth Certificate Chatbot](/use-cases/birth-certificate-chatbot) - Improves citizen access to administrative services
